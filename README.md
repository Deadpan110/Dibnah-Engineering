Dibnah-Engineering
==================

A Kerbal Space Program Engineering and Tuning company.

Real Life Inspiration
---------------------

As a young school leaver with an interest in mechanical engineering and science
many years ago, I got a job as an apprentice at a factory learning how to
maintain and repair Victorian machinery. As well as being young and foolish and
the eventual decline of the industry - the job was no more but the interest
stuck with me.
My interest in Astrophysics and other sciences also grew stronger as I got older
so it was of no surprise that I really enjoy playing Kerbal Space Program as
much as I can.
Great engineers like [Fred Dibnah (28 April 1938 – 6 November 2004)]
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Dibnah) are still big inspirations to me and
I am sure that if Fred wasn't climbing chimneys, he would be climbing rockets.
This fictitious Kerbal Space Program company is dedicated to the greats of
Engineering and Science with hopes of providing a few extra fun parts for others
to include in their game.

   into GameData\DibnahEngineering

#### Frequently Asked Questions ####

* Why is it too hard to create a small amount of liquidHydrogen, I was hoping to
  land, refuel and take off with out having to wait years?
  * Real life Hydrogen production is not done in large quantities using
    electrolysis of water as it is very costly and highly time consuming
    (most Hydrogen from Earth is produced by the processing of fossil fuels).
    These parts use the same conversion ratios as the Universal Storage Elektron
    (which is based on the real thing operating in the International space
    station) but also uses larger conversion rates which will requires a lot 
    more ElectricCharge.
    Please feel free to use the included ModuleManager files so as to produce
    liquidHydrogen at unrealistic but more playable rates.
* The consumption of ElectricCharge is too high/too low - is that right?
  * ElectricCharge usage is based on the rates from Universal Storage which uses
  	the value of [1EC=33J]
  	(http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/75129?p=1504667&viewfull=1#post1504667).
	Other mods and parts use differing values so the correctness of what the
	actual values are could possibly remain forever in debate until Squad 
	publish what the actual values should be. As these parts follow the ratios
	from Universal Storage, the ElectricCharge usage will only be changed if
	Universal Storage changes and so will always remain in sync.
	Please feel free to use the included ModuleManager files so as to use less
	ElectricCharge if you feel the current settings are too high for your style
	of gameplay.
* I filled up all my Oxygen tanks and the Electrolysis unit stopped working, why
  didn't it just carry on producing regardless?
  * When it comes to space exploration, Oxygen is an important resource and it
    seems a shame to waste it. More from a gameplay point of view, managing
    resources and visiting your outposts once in a while introduces small
    challenges and reasons for more smaller missions to accomplish minor goals.
    I recommend using the [Fuel Valve from Smart Parts]
    (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64227) to bleed off the excess.
    Please feel free to use the included ModuleManager files so as full Oxygen
    storage will not halt your Hydrogen production.
* So how exactly are you playing your game with these parts?
  * I certainly do not play with the default settings as being too realistic can
    destroy fun, gameplay and make these parts totally useless for most players.
    I do however, like to use the Smart Tools Fuel Valve so having no space for
    Oxygen stops Hydrogen production.
    Please feel free to use any or all of the included ModuleManager files to
    tailor these parts to the way you want to play.
* Why should we just drop in ModuleManger files, wouldn't it be easier just to
  supply the parts with those values already included?
  * Having parts where values are totally unrealistic and way off is a simple
    approach but will not be believable. The default configs match Universal
    Storage with Paul Kingtiger and Daishi's research on the Electrolosys unit
    aboard the International Space Station. Regardless of the accuracy, the
    production of Hydrogen is very time consuming and requires large quantities
    of power. With this as a baseline, it is then possible to tweak and adjust
    the values to individual needs in the hope of providing the best ratios for
    everyones style of gameplay.
    For Example: If you want to use less ElectricCharge, you have a base value
    to work from.
    Feel free to use any of the provided ModuleManager configs to adjust the
    parts to suit your game style.
* The ModuleManager configs don't suit my game style - what should I do?
  * Feel free to write your own - really, it is entirely up to you how hard or
    how easy Hydrogen production should be.
    Use the existing configs if you are unsure on how to write one or ask in the
    [DibnahEngineering forum thread]
    (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/99608) for help.
