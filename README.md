Dibnah-Engineering
==================

A Kerbal Space Program Engineering and Tuning company.

Real Life Inspiration
---------------------

As a young school leaver with an interest in mechanical engineering and science
many years ago, I got a job as an apprentice at a factory learning how to
maintain and repair Victorian machinery. As well as being young and foolish and
the eventual decline of the industry - the job was no more but the interest
stuck with me.
My interest in Astrophysics and other sciences also grew stronger as I got older
so it was of no suprise that I really enjoy playing Kerbal Space Program as much
as I can.
Great engineers like [Fred Dibnah (28 April 1938 – 6 November 2004)]
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Dibnah) are still big inspirations to me and
I am sure that if Fred wasn't climbing chimneys, he would be climbing rockets.
This fictitious Kerbal Space Program company is dedicated to the greats of
Engineering and Science with hopes of providing a few extra fun parts for others
to include in their game.
