Dibnah-Engineering
==================

A Kerbal Space Program Engineering and Tuning company.

Real Life Inspiration
---------------------

As a young school leaver with an interest in mechanical engineering and science many years ago, I got a job as an apprentice at a factory learning how to maintain and repair Victorian machinary. As well as being young and foolish and the eventual decline of the industry - the job was no more but the intrest stuck with me.
My interest in Astrophysics and other sciences also grew stronger as I got older so it was of no suprise that I really enjoy playing Kerbal Space Program as much as I can.
Great engineers like [Fred Dibnah (28 April 1938 â€“ 6 November 2004)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Dibnah) are still big inspirations to me and I am sure that if Fred wasn't climbing chimneys, he would be climbing rockets.
This Kerbal Space Program company is dedicated to the greats of Engineering and Science with hopes of providing a few extra fun parts for others to include in their game.
